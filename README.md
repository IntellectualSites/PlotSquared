PlotSquared is a land and world management plugin for Minecraft.
It includes several highly configurable world generators.
You can create plots of land in existing worlds using plot clusters, or you can have a full world of plots.

For the end user, PlotSquared is packed with a tonne of cool features.
It allows you to merge plots, and build together with your friends.
You can also change a lot of plot specific settings in the form of
flags. Such as: weather, time, game modes, pvp status.

Whilst we provide a whole load of unique features, the biggest focus
is to provide a lag-free and smooth experience.
