# Contributing
If you feel like you can improve the plugin any way, then you are
more than welcome to contribute to PlotSquared. It would be highly
appreciated if you made sure to test your code before committing it, 
as it will save us a lot of time and effort.

### Code Style

If you are planning to commit any changes to the project,
it would be highly appreciated if you were to follow the 
project code style conventions. To make this easier we have
provided settings that can be imported into your IDE.

**Eclipse:**
`Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter`
Press `Import` and select `...path/to/project/code_style.xml`

**IntelliJ:**
`File > Settings > Editor > Code Style`. Next to "Scheme" there is a cog wheel, press that and then
`Import Scheme > IntelliJ IDEA Code Style XML` and then select `..path/to/project/code_style.xml`
